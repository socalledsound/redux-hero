# redux hero

I took a nice old tutorial : https://decembersoft.com/posts/redux-hero-part-1-a-hero-is-born-a-fun-introduction-to-redux-js/

and spruced it up a bit.

branch 1 is a scaffold.  
branch 2 createActions + more complex state  
branch 3 reselect  
branch 4 redux-sagas  
branch 5 redux-testing-sagas
